      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">A little about the Past 10 years or so</h5>
        <p>Where do I begin? I graduated from Grant High School in Portland Oregon in 2011. Following graduation I picked up a job at Amalfis Italian Restaurant where I spent the last 8 years. I was always a quiet, shy kid, so going into an industry where interacting with people is a major portion of your job was a bit of a change of pace for me. It definitley changed me for the better and has made me a lot more gregarious! between working at Amalfi's I did contract painting for a few months in 2013, as well as temporary warehouse work for Kendall floral during their busy seasons between 2015 and 2016</p>
        <h5><strong>Why <em>Epicodus?</em></strong></h5>
        <p>Back in august of 2019, My friend, Quinn, was telling me about his new job he landed at Vicasa. I was interested in how he managed to land such an awesome gig. He told me about Epicodus and how the program works. At the time, I was getting pretty tired of the late night hours and the wonky schedule that is part of working in a restaurant and was looking for a new career. After he told me what to expect and what I would need to do to succeed, I had made up my mind. later that same day I began to look into Epicodus and signed up for the Intro to Programming part time course. After about a month of the intro program I had made up my mind, i was going to enroll in the full time course. The thing that appealed to me in particular about Epicodus was their internship program, getting a foot in the door can be a major struggle for anyone looking to start a new career, and knowing that the program guarantees an internship was huge to me.</p>
